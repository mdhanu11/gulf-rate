        "question": "Is Gulf Rate a money transfer service?",
        "answer": "No, Gulf Rate is a comparison platform. We help you find the best exchange rates and transfer services, but we don't process transfers ourselves. Once you find a provider with favorable rates, you'll be directed to their official website to complete your transaction."

      {
        "question": "How do rate alerts work?",
        "answer": "When you sign up for rate alerts, you can specify your target exchange rate. Once any of our providers offers a rate that meets or exceeds your target, we'll send you an immediate notification via email or SMS so you can take advantage of the favorable rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which currencies does Gulf Rate support?",
        "answer": "We currently focus on the most popular corridors for expatriates in Saudi Arabia, including Saudi Riyal (SAR) to Indian Rupee (INR), Pakistani Rupee (PKR), Philippine Peso (PHP), Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), Nepalese Rupee (NPR), Egyptian Pound (EGP), and major global currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP."
